### Mainary programming languages
It is important to be able to solve any problem we face without imposing too many limits. C/C++ can provide us with control over the CPU and RAM. They are fast languages and are almost backward compatible, allowing us to write both low-level and high-level code. On the other hand, Python is a high-level language that is easy to use. It has a wealth of useful libraries and frameworks to meet various needs. Shell scripting is essential for automating tasks on Unix systems.

### Secondary programming languages
Every software engineer should possess the knowledge and experience to work with a diverse range of technologies, including those with which he may have limited experience. This may involve creating Android applications, developing web applications, writing client-server software and utilties, and even recording documentation.

### Databases I work with
Data is one of the most essential entities today, especially in the era of big data. Almost every development process involves working with databases. There are two most popular types of databases - relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL). It is important to be able to choose and work with both, as each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

### OS I work with
Software engineers are accustomed to working with different operating systems due to the various tasks they may encounter. Generally, there may not be a significant difference in Unix systems, but knowing the details can make it easier to troubleshoot any issues that may occur, such as when starting a container, for example.

### Technologies and frameworks
There are essential tools for any software engineer. These include automation tools like Cron and Kubernetes, code versioning systems like Git, and build systems such as Gradle and CMake that help with code checking, testing, and compilation to build the final product. Additionally, there are frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI that can significantly simplify the process of creating web applications or APIs. It's important for every software engineer to seek out and study these tools, as it prevents reinventing the wheel and facilitates efficient development.
